## About
Most people in this modern era have a smartphone. But what about those who don't?
Or those on a severely limited data plan that would like to minimize usage?

How convenient would it be to be able to text your computer to perform certain tasks
for you, like looking up directions, launching a program, or looking up a definition?

Sure, a VNC server can perform these tasks and more in a much more robust interface,
but the SMSBot can keep things at a bare minimum. With a phone supporting MMS and a
GMail account, you can control your computer with text messaging!
